72. Edit Distance

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')





class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
    // DP talbe, i is the position in word1, and j is the position in word2
    vector<vector<int>> distance(word1.length()+1, vector<int>(word2.length()+1, 0));
    
    // when i or j=0 means empty string, the distance is the length of another string
    for(int i=0; i<distance.size(); i++)
        for(int j=0; j< distance[0].size();j++){
            if(i == 0)
                distance[i][j] = j;
            else if(j == 0)
                distance[i][j] = i;
        }
    
    // if word1[i]==word2[j], then the distance of i and j is the previous i and j
    // otherwise we either replace, insert or delete a char
    // when insert a char to word1 it means we are trying to match word1 at i-1 to word2 at j
    // when delete a char from word1 it equals to insert a char to word2, which
    // means we are trying to match word1 at i to word2 at j-1
    // when replace a char to word1, then we add one step to previous i and j
    for(int i=1; i< distance.size(); i++)
        for(int j=1; j<distance[0].size(); j++){
            if(word1[i-1] == word2[j-1])
                distance[i][j] = distance[i-1][j-1];
            else                      //                          //  Remove              // Insert 
                distance[i][j] = 1+ min(distance[i-1][j-1], min(distance[i-1][j], distance[i][j-1]));
        }
        
    return distance[word1.length()][word2.length()];
}
    
        
    
};
