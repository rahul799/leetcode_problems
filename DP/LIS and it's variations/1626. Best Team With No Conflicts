1626. Best Team With No Conflicts

You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. 
The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the basketball team is not allowed to have conflicts. A conflict exists if a younger player has a strictly higher score than an older player. A
conflict does not occur between players of the same age.

Given two lists, scores and ages, where each scores[i] and ages[i] represents the score and age of the ith player, respectively, return the highest overall
score of all possible basketball teams.



The idea is to sort array of tuples (age, score) by age, then we can eliminate the age factor because as long as we choose elements at index i and j so that i > j then the age inside tuples[i] >= the age inside tuple[j], and we will not have conflicts.

For example:

[1,5,3,10,15]
[1,3,2,4,5]
The sorted tuples is:

[(1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 5), (4, 10), (5, 15)]
Then this problem became Find the maximum sum non-decreasing sub sequences of scores array [1, 3, 5, 10, 15]
We can just use Dynamic programing to solve it. To learn more about DP for this series of questions non-decreasing sub sequence please have a look at this problem :






class Solution {
public:
    int bestTeamScore(vector<int>& scores, vector<int>& ages) {
        const int n = scores.size();
        vector<int> dp(n, 0);
        // first: age
        // second: scores
        vector<pair<int, int>> arr(n, {0, 0}); 
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            arr[i].first = ages[i];
            arr[i].second = scores[i];
        }
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        // DP initialization
        dp[0] = arr[0].second;
        int team_score = dp[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
            dp[i] = arr[i].second;
            for(int j = i - 1; j >= 0; --j){
                // arr sorted by age, latter element has to have high score to maintain increasing susequence
                if(arr[i].second >= arr[j].second){
                    // update each status
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + arr[i].second); 
                }
            }
            // maximum value could in any place
            team_score = max(team_score, dp[i]); 
        }
        return team_score;
    }
};
