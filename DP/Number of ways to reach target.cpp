You are given an N by M matrix of 0s and 1s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner? Mod the result by 10 ** 9 + 7.

You can only move right and down. 0 represents an empty space while 1 represents a wall you cannot walk through. The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be 0.

Constraints

n, m â‰¤ 100 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in matrix.
Example 1
Input
matrix = [
    [0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0]
]
Output
2
Explanation
There are two ways to get to the bottom right:

Right, down, down, right
Down, right, down, right
Example 2
Input
matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
]
Output
6
Explanation
There are 6 ways here:

Right, right, down, down
Down, down, right, right
Right, down, right, down
Down, right, down, right
Right, down, down, right
Down, right, right, down

                dp[i][j] = t1 + t2;
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n - 1][m - 1] % 1000000007;
