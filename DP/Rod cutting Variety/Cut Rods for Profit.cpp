Cut Rods for Profit
You are given a list of integers rod_lens, where each element represents the length of a rod. You are also given integers profit_per_len and cost_per_cut. You make profit_per_len profit per unit length of a rod but you can only sell rods that are all of the same length. You can also cut a rod into two integer pieces but each cut costs cost_per_cut. You can cut a rod as many times as you want. Return the maximum profit that can be made.

Constraints

n ≤ 1,000 where n is the length of rod_lens
m ≤ 1,000 where m is the maximum value in rod_lens
Example 1
Input
rod_lens = [5, 8]
profit_per_len = 6
cost_per_cut = 4
Output
64
Explanation
We can cut the rod of length 5 into two rods, one with length 4 and the other 1. We can then cut the rod of length 8 into two rods, both with length 4. Then we can sell all 3 rods of length 4 for a total profit of (4 + 4 + 4) * 6 - 8.

Example 2
Input
rod_lens = [5, 1]
profit_per_len = 1
cost_per_cut = 100
Output
5
Explanation
Since the cost to cut is too expensive, we just sell the rod with length 5.





we will just brute force every length on how much profit we can make on a particular type of length
since n,m are <=1000 so it will get ac

int solve(vector<int>& rod_lens, int profitp, int costc) {
    int n = rod_lens.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    int s = 1;
    int e = *max_element(rod_lens.begin(), rod_lens.end());
    int max_profit = 0;
    for (int i = s; i <= e; i++) {
        int curr_profit = 0;

        for (auto l : rod_lens) {
            if (l == i)
                curr_profit += (profitp * l);
            else {
                int total = (l - 1) / i;
                int pieces = l / i;
                curr_profit += max(0, (pieces * i) * profitp - total * costc);
            }
            max_profit = max(max_profit, curr_profit);
        }
        // cout<<max_profit<<" "<<endl;
    }
    return max_profit;
}
