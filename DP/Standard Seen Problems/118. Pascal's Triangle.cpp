Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:


 

Example 1:

Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
Example 2:

Input: numRows = 1
Output: [[1]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= numRows <= 30








class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
        //creates a vector triangle with numRows number of inner vectors of size 1 and value 1
        vector<vector<int>> triangle(numRows, vector<int> (1,1));
        
        if(numRows == 0) return triangle; 
        
        vector<int> prevRow;
		
		//We start the for loop from 1st index because the vector at 0th index of triangle is already intialized with 1
		//if the numRows is 1, then we do not enter the for loop and simply skip to return triangle
        for(int currRow = 1; currRow<numRows ; currRow++)
        {
            prevRow = triangle[currRow-1]; 
            for(int i=1;i<currRow;i++)
            {
			   //this loop fills up the elements apart from the 1st and last element of the vector
                triangle[currRow].push_back(prevRow[i] + prevRow[i-1]);
            }
            triangle[currRow].push_back(1);      //setting the last element of the vector as 1      
        }        
        return triangle;
    }
};
