You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

Example 1:

Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
Example 2:

Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
Example 3:

Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
 

Note:

You can assume that

0 <= amount <= 5000
1 <= coin <= 5000
the number of coins is less than 500
the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer



class Solution {
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        if(amount == 0)
            return 1;
        if(coins.size() == 0)
            return 0;
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < coins.size(); ++ i){
            for(int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; ++ j){
                dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]];
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
};




Time complexity: \mathcal{O}(N \times \textrm{amount})O(NÃ—amount), where N is a length of coins array.

Space complexity: \mathcal{O}(\textrm{amount})O(amount) to keep dp array.
