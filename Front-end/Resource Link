If you find this post helpful, kindly upvote it this gives me motivation to write. Thanks a lot everyone!!

Hi Everyone,
I have interviewed for Front end roles at Facebook, Amazon, and few other non-fang companies. I just wanted to share some resources as I know how hard it is to find useful resources for front-end preparation.
At the end of this post, I'll list down some resources shared by FANG recruiters for preparation. ðŸ˜Š

First and the most important thing:-

Get really comfortable with vanilla JS and it's primitives.
Know how the functions are implemented under the hood.
Know how to code some of the library(like Lodash, RxJs, etc) implementations from scratch, such as:                         
* Implementation of debounce
* Implementation of throttle
* Implement Observable
* Implement EvenEmitter
Know ES6 well.
Generally asked question covers:-

Explain "this" keyword
Know how to manipulate DOM API's, querying the structure of a DOM
Asynchronous programming
Closures
Callbacks
Implementation Promises
Prototypal inheritance
Polyfill for Call(), apply() and bind()
Polyfill for map, filter
let, const and var
Some HTML/CSS and javascript mix questions:-

Arrange 3 divs (which share a common parent) in a row.
Implement sum(a).(b).(c) in Javascript.
Event loop
Given a parent and child div (the dimensions of both parent and child are not pre determined). What are the various ways in which child can be aligned to centre of div.
Web security questions:-

Explain CORS.
What is CSRF attack? Explain with an example and how to prevent it.
Explain XSS, etc.
Don't forget to study DS & Algo as well, though the questions are JS heavy but it's still good to have DS knowledge (I have been asked medium to hard level LC)

I used freecodecamps DS series:

I prepared mostly from the resources provided by recruiters, but this website helped to practise on some variety of problems:

Zalando and DeliveryHero:-
General interview questions + medium to hard level leetcode problem

https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions
Resources provided by companies:-
(These are mostly books but I would highly recommend to go through this if you have time. This will strengthen your core understanding of JS which is key to crack the interviews)

The Modern JavaScript Tutorial http://javascript.info/
JavaScript Garden: http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/
Eloquent JavaScript: http://eloquentjavascript.net/

A re-introduction to JavaScript | MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript


Practise stuff:-

I couldn't find the actual JS quiz by David Shariff, but here is a nice explanation of that quiz:

Going for Amazon- don't forget to prepare for the 14 leadership priciples (using STAR method)

Bonus:-

Asked to implement searchbar (I used trie)
Please feel free to add more questions or resources, this can help somebody who is preparing.
