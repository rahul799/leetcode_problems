There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:



Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2
Output: 2
 

Note:

N will be in the range [1, 100].
K will be in the range [1, N].
The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 0 <= w <= 100.








class Solution {
public:
    int networkDelayTime(vector<vector<int>>& times, int N, int K) {
        vector<int> dist(N + 1, INT_MAX);
        dist[K] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (vector<int> e : times) {
                int u = e[0], v = e[1], w = e[2];
                if (dist[u] != INT_MAX && dist[v] > dist[u] + w) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                }
            }
        }

        int maxwait = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
            maxwait = max(maxwait, dist[i]);
        return maxwait == INT_MAX ? -1 : maxwait;
    }
};






The idea is to find the time to reach every other node from given node K
Then, to check if all nodes can be reached and if it can be reached then return the time taken to reach the farthest node (node which take longest to get the signal).
As the signal traverses concurrently to all nodes, we have to find the maximum time it takes to reach a node among all nodes from given node K.
If any single node takes Integer.MAX_Value, then return -1, as not all nodes can be reached

add the index of all the nodes which can be reached from a node to a list and store this list in a hashmap






typedef pair<int, int> pii;

class Solution {
public:
    int networkDelayTime(vector<vector<int>>& times, int n, int k) {
        vector<pii> g[n + 1];
        for (const auto& t : times) {
            g[t[0]].emplace_back(t[1], t[2]);
        }
        const int inf = 1e9;
        vector<int> dist(n + 1, inf);
        dist[k] = 0;
        priority_queue<pii, vector<pii>, greater<pii> > pq;
        pq.emplace(0, k);
        int u, v, w;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            pii p = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            u = p.second;
            for (auto& to : g[u]) {
                v = to.first, w = to.second;
                if (dist[v] > dist[u] + w) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                    pq.emplace(dist[v], v);
                }
            }
        }
        int ans = *max_element(dist.begin() + 1, dist.end());
        return ans == inf ? -1 : ans;
    }
};
