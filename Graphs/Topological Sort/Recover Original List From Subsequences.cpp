Given a two-dimensional list of integers lists, where each list is a subsequence of an original list, return the original list. The original list contains unique numbers. There is guaranteed to be one unique solution.

Constraints

n * m â‰¤ 100,000 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in lists
Example 1
Input

lists = [
    [1, 3],
    [2, 3],
    [1, 2]
]
Output

[1, 2, 3]
Example 2
Input

lists = [
    [1, 2, 4],
    [2, 3, 4]
]
Output

[1, 2, 3, 4]
Example 3
Input

lists = [
    [1, 2, 3]
]
Output

[1, 2, 3]




We can treat this problem as a sorting problem - we know that for some pairs of values x and y, x must appear before y - what ordering respects these constraints?

More specifically, if we construct a graph where each number correspond to a vertex and we have a directed edge from x to y if and only if, in some list, x appears directly beforey, then we can run topological sort on this directed graph in order to extract the original ordering.

Implementation
We construct the graph as follows - we loop over each list and throw all the numbers we see into an unordered_set. We loop over all pairs of elements and write in a directed edge for all pairs (x, y) where x appears directly before y. We also keep track of how many unprocessed parent vertices a current vertex has to process in numParents.

After that, we run topological sort. We loop over all vertices to find any that do not have any unprocessed parent vertices. After that, we scan over the vertices and "process" them by decrementing the number of unprocessed parent vertices for each child vertex - if a child vertex has no more unprocessed parent nodes, then it is eligible to be enqueued.

Time Complexity
We use \mathcal{O}(MN)O(MN) time as we construct a graph with that many vertices and at most that many edges, and then run a topological sort on it which also runs in time linear in the size of the graph.

Space Complexity
Since the graph takes \mathcal{O}(MN)O(MN) space to express, the space complexity is also \mathcal{O}(MN)O(MN).

vector<int> solve(vector<vector<int>>& lists) {
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> edges;
    unordered_set<int> vertices;
    unordered_map<int, int> numParents;
    for (auto& list : lists) {
        vertices.insert(list[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i++) {
            vertices.insert(list[i]);
            edges[list[i - 1]].push_back(list[i]);
            numParents[list[i]]++;
        }
    }
    vector<int> ret;
    for (int vertex : vertices) {
        if (numParents[vertex] == 0) {
            ret.push_back(vertex);
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < ret.size(); i++) {
        for (int child : edges[ret[i]]) {
            if (--numParents[child] == 0) {
                ret.push_back(child);
            }
        }
    }
    return ret;
}
