Fair Pay
You are given a list of integers ratings representing the performance scores of programmers. The manager would like to give $1 to every programmer except if two programmers are adjacent, they'd like to pay the better performing programmer at least $1 higher than the worse performing one.

Return the minimum amount of dollars the manager can pay following above constraints.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 5000 where n is the length of ratings.
Example 1
Input

ratings = [1, 2, 5, 1]
Output

7
