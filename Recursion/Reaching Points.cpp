A move consists of taking a point (x, y) and transforming it to either (x, x+y) or (x+y, y).

Given a starting point (sx, sy) and a target point (tx, ty), return True if and only if a sequence of moves exists to transform the point (sx, sy) to (tx, ty). Otherwise, return False.

Examples:
Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 3, ty = 5
Output: True
Explanation:
One series of moves that transforms the starting point to the target is:
(1, 1) -> (1, 2)
(1, 2) -> (3, 2)
(3, 2) -> (3, 5)

Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 2
Output: False

Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 1, ty = 1
Output: True

Note:

sx, sy, tx, ty will all be integers in the range [1, 10^9].


The idea to write any of the recursive solution is first write the base cases then write the number of choices you are going to have

class Solution {
    public boolean reachingPoints(int sx, int sy, int tx, int ty) {
        if (sx > tx || sy > ty) return false;
        if (sx == tx && sy == ty) return true;
        return reachingPoints(sx+sy, sy, tx, ty) || reachingPoints(sx, sx+sy, tx, ty);
    }
}

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(2^{tx + ty})O(2 
tx+ty
 ), a loose bound found by considering every move as (x, y) -> (x+1, y) or (x, y) -> (x, y+1) instead.

Space Complexity: O(tx * ty)O(txâˆ—ty), the size of the implicit call stack.






Approach #4: Work Backwards (Modulo Variant) [Accepted]
Intuition

As in Approach #3, we work backwards to find the answer, trying to transform the target point to the starting point via 
applying the parent operation (x, y) -> (x-y, y) or (x, y-x) [depending on which one doesn't have negative coordinates.]

We can speed up this transformation by bundling together parent operations.

Algorithm

Say tx > ty. We know that the next parent operations will be to subtract ty from tx, until such time that tx = tx % ty. When both tx > ty and ty > sy, we can perform all these parent operations in one step, replacing while tx > ty: tx -= ty with tx %= ty.

Otherwise, if say tx > ty and ty <= sy, then we know ty will not be changing (it can only decrease). Thus, only tx will 
change, and it can only change by subtracting by ty. Hence, (tx - sx) % ty == 0 is a necessary and sufficient condition 
for the problem's answer to be True.

The analysis above was for the case tx > ty, but the case ty > tx is similar. When tx == ty, no more moves can be made.



Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(\log(\max{(tx, ty)}))O(log(max(tx,ty))). The analysis is similar to the analysis of the Euclidean
algorithm, and we assume that the modulo operation can be done in O(1)O(1) time.

Space Complexity: O(1)O(1)







Unoptimised

class Solution {
public:
	bool reachingPoints(int sx, int sy, int tx, int ty) {
		if(tx<sx || ty<sy) return false;
		if(tx==sx)
			return (ty-sy)%sx==0;
		if(ty==sy)
			return (tx-sx)%sy==0;
		if(tx>ty)
			return reachingPoints(sx,sy,tx-ty,ty);
		else
			return reachingPoints(sx,sy,tx,ty-tx);
	}
};
