| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+

+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
The buyer with id 1 bought an S8 but didn't buy an iPhone. The buyer with id 3 bought both.







# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT DISTINCT buyer_id FROM Sales s JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id 
WHERE product_name = "iPhone" OR product_name = "S8"
GROUP BY buyer_id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_name) = 1 AND MIN(product_name) = "S8"




SELECT S.BUYER_ID FROM SALES AS S , PRODUCT AS P
    WHERE S.PRODUCT_ID = P.PRODUCT_ID AND P.PRODUCT_NAME = 'S8'
		AND
		BUYER_ID NOT IN 
				(SELECT S2.BUYER_ID FROM SALES AS S2 , PRODUCT AS P2 
					WHERE S2.PRODUCT_id = P2.PRODUCT_ID 
							AND 
							P2.PRODUCT_NAME = 'iPhone'
				)
    GROUP BY BUYER_ID
