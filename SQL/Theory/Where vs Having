e main difference between WHERE and HAVING clause comes when used together with GROUP BY clause,
In that case WHERE is used to filter rows before grouping and HAVING is used to exclude records after grouping.
This is the most important difference and if you remember this, it will help you write better SQL queries. This is also one
