Since we need to check just the previous and the next characters, we can fulfil any pattern using maximum 3 characters.
We just need to check if both previous and next characters are different from 'a', 'b' or 'c' and put the one which satisfy the condition.
The C++ code is quite easy and runs in O(N):
