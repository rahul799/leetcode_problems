Level with Minimum Sum
Question 184 of 991
Given a binary tree tree, return the level of the tree with minimum sum. Note that the level of a tree starts at 0.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in tree
Example 1
Input
Visualize
root =
2

0

1

Output
1
Explanation
Level 1 has the lowest sum.

Example 2
Input
Visualize
r



Explanation
Level 0 has sum of -2
Level 1 has sum of 2
Level 2 has sum of 3
Level 3 has sum of 9

            minLevel = currLevel;
        }

        currLevel += 1;
    }

    return minLevel;
