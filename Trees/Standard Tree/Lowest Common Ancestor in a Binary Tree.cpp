Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree | Set 1

Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the least common ancestor.



 If we assume that the keys n1 and n2 are present in Binary Tree, we can find LCA using single traversal of Binary Tree and without extra storage for path arrays.
The idea is to traverse the tree starting from root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with root, then root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present). If 
root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys, we recur for left and right subtree. The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present in right subtree
is the LCA. If both keys lie in left subtree, then left subtree has LCA also, otherwise LCA lies
in right subtree.




/* C++ Program to find LCA of n1 and n2 using one traversal of Binary Tree */
#include <iostream> 

using namespace std; 

// A Binary Tree Node 
struct Node 
{ 
	struct Node *left, *right; 
	int key; 
}; 

// Utility function to create a new tree Node 
Node* newNode(int key) 
{ 
	Node *temp = new Node; 
	temp->key = key; 
	temp->left = temp->right = NULL; 
	return temp; 
} 

// This function returns pointer to LCA of two given values n1 and n2. 
// This function assumes that n1 and n2 are present in Binary Tree 
struct Node *findLCA(struct Node* root, int n1, int n2) 
{ 
	// Base case 
	if (root == NULL) return NULL; 

	
	if (root->key == n1 || root->key == n2) 
		return root; 

	// Look for keys in left and right subtrees 
	Node *left_lca = findLCA(root->left, n1, n2); 
	Node *right_lca = findLCA(root->right, n1, n2); 

	// If both of the above calls return Non-NULL, then one key 
	// is present in once subtree and other is present in other, 
	// So this node is the LCA 
	if (left_lca && right_lca) return root; 

	// Otherwise check if left subtree or right subtree is LCA 
	return (left_lca != NULL)? left_lca: right_lca; 
} 









// Driver program to test above functions 
int main() 
{ 
	// Let us create binary tree given in the above example 
	Node * root = newNode(1); 
	root->left = newNode(2); 
	root->right = newNode(3); 
	root->left->left = newNode(4); 
	root->left->right = newNode(5); 
	root->right->left = newNode(6); 
	root->right->right = newNode(7); 
	cout << "LCA(4, 5) = " << findLCA(root, 4, 5)->key; 
	cout << "nLCA(4, 6) = " << findLCA(root, 4, 6)->key; 
	cout << "nLCA(3, 4) = " << findLCA(root, 3, 4)->key; 
	cout << "nLCA(2, 4) = " << findLCA(root, 2, 4)->key; 
	return 0; 
}
