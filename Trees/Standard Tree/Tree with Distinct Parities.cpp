Tree with Distinct Parities
Question 1 of 4
Given a binary tree root, return the number of perfect nodes. A perfect node has two properties:

Has both children
The sum of one subtree is even and the sum of the other subtree is odd
Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in root
Example 1
Input
Visualize


Output
2
Explanation
Nodes 1 and 3 meet the criteria.

Example 2
Input
Visualize
root =
1

2

3

Output
